THRONE_DIAL2,[color=#ffa500]...
THRONE_DIAL3,[color=#ffa500]…Maybe I don’t have to d-
THRONE_DIAL4,[color=#ffa500]Oh. So you finally arrived.
THRONE_DIAL5,[color=#ffa500]It certainly took you two a while to get here.
THRONE_DIAL6,"|moony|[color=grey]Uh, dude. We’ve been looking all over for you!"
THRONE_DIAL7,|ena|[color=yellow]Verily! Why did you depart from us?
THRONE_DIAL8,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]…This is what we’ve all been searching for, isn't it?"
THRONE_DIAL9,[color=#ffa500]The very thing threatening all of [color=red]existence.
THRONE_DIAL10,[color=#ffa500]...
THRONE_DIAL11,"[color=#ffa500]Ever since I left you two, I’ve been busy."
THRONE_DIAL12,[color=#ffa500]I've been trying to figure out how to stop the [color=purple]rift [color=#ffa500]myself.
THRONE_DIAL13,"[color=#ffa500]And so now, my plan can move forward."
THRONE_DIAL14,[color=#ffa500]A plan that can truly guarantee the end of our quest.
THRONE_DIAL15,|moony|[color=grey]Great! One question.
THRONE_DIAL16,[color=grey]WHY COULDN'T YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO US BEFORE YOU LEFT?
THRONE_DIAL17,|meist|[color=#ffa500]I felt like I was more capable to solve this. 
THRONE_DIAL18,"|ena|[color=yellow]Chums are supposed to stick together. We're a team, remember?"
THRONE_DIAL19,|moony|[color=grey]Yeah. Tell us where you’re going next time ya nerd.
THRONE_DIAL20,|meist|[color=#ffa500]Fair enough.
THRONE_DIAL21,[color=#ffa500]...
THRONE_DIAL22,[color=#ffa500]Then let us complete this long journey. ||
HALLWAY_DIAL1,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]I haven’t told you much about my world, haven’t I Ena?"
HALLWAY_DIAL2,[color=#ffa500]It was a complete paradise. There was next to no suffering.
HALLWAY_DIAL3,[color=#ffa500]But it wasn’t perfect.
HALLWAY_DIAL4,"[color=#ffa500]As our people lived very long lives, we were beginning to run out of space."
HALLWAY_DIAL5,[color=#ffa500]And so I was tasked by the royal family to solve this issue.
HALLWAY_DIAL6,"[color=#ffa500]Unfortunately as you can see, it was all in vain."
HALLWAY_DIAL7,"[color=#ffa500]But now however, I can finally fix all of this."
HALLWAY_DIAL8,"|ena|[color=yellow]Pray tell us chum, how did your world die?"
HALLWAY_DIAL9,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...
HALLWAY_DIAL10,"|moony|[color=grey]But you can fix this, and stop the rift. Right?"
HALLWAY_DIAL11,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]Of course, but it won’t be an easy task."
HALLWAY_DIAL12,"|moony|[color=grey]Uh, what do you mean by that?"
HALLWAY_DIAL13,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL1,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...What is this?
GARDEN_DIAL2,|ena|[color=yellow]What seems to be the issue?
GARDEN_DIAL3,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL4,[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL5,[color=#ffa500]I think it's time to tell you my plan.
GARDEN_DIAL6,"[color=#ffa500]Throughout your journey, you have gained so much power."
GARDEN_DIAL7,"[color=#ffa500]The power you wield, is most certainly enough to destroy the glitched rift."
GARDEN_DIAL8,"[color=#ffa500]However, I cannot allow this to happen."
GARDEN_DIAL9,"[color=#ffa500]If you destroy it now, I will never have another chance to save my world."
GARDEN_DIAL10,[color=#ffa500]That is why…
GARDEN_DIAL11,[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL12,[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL13,[color=#ffa500]…I need to take your ESSENCE.
GARDEN_DIAL14,|ena|[color=blue]W-WHAT?!
