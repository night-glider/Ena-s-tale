OVERWORLD_DOG_DIALOGUE2,|over_nar|It looks at you with hope in its eyes.
HALLWAY_RUMBLE_DIALOGUE,"|over_nar|@0.04@Looks like the portal was destroyed, no turning back now."
PRE_THRONE_MOONY_DIALOUGE1,|moony|[color=grey]@0.04@Can't believe we're finally here. Man this place is decrepit.
PRE_THRONE_MOONY_DIALOUGE2,[color=grey]Lets just hope we finally found [color=red]him.
POST_THRONE_MOONY_DIALOUGE1,"|moony|[color=grey]So glad this will finally be over, but something doesnt feel right."
POST_THRONE_MOONY_DIALOUGE2,"[color=grey]Even though hes our bud, be careful. He seems conflicted about something."
DIALOGUE_THRONE1,|over_nar|This throne seems like its in pretty bad shape.
DIALOGUE_THRONE2,"|over_nar|I wonder, was it his throne?"
MURAL1_DIAL1,"@0.04@|ena|[color=yellow]Gracious me, these appear to be murals of our adventure!"
MURAL1_DIAL2,"|moony|[color=grey]What makes you say that, Ena?"
MURAL1_DIAL3,"|ena|[color=yellow]Well, we saw the enterance of the castle already, and this appears to be the same."
MURAL1_DIAL4,|moony|[color=grey]Fair enough I guess. Lets check out the rest up ahead.
MURAL2_DIAL1,@0.04@|ena|[color=yellow]These accursed [color=red]glitched rifts[color=white]...
MURAL2_DIAL2,"|moony|[color=grey]After we escaped from Runas, they've been giving us a lot of trouble lately."
MURAL2_DIAL3,"|moony|[color=grey]Thankfully, we have closed nearly all of them and have located the last one."
MURAL2_DIAL4,|ena|[color=yellow]Lets just hope that [color=#ffa500]he [color=yellow]is here as well.
MURAL3_DIAL1,"@0.04@|ena|[color=yellow]Moony, I know I've already said this before but..."
MURAL3_DIAL2,|moony|[color=grey]Don't worry about it. We needed [color=purple]their [color=grey]help in order to leave.
MURAL3_DIAL3,|moony|[color=grey]Lets just keep moving.
MURAL4_DIAL1,"@0.04@|ena|[color=yellow]Thats odd, [color=#ffa500]he [color=yellow]should be in this one."
MURAL4_DIAL2,"|moony|[color=grey]Yeah, they were with us for most of our adventure."
MURAL4_DIAL3,|ena|[color=yellow]Do you think they used to rule this place?
MURAL4_DIAL4,|moony|[color=grey]Maybe? I dunno. Ask him when find him here.
MURAL5_DIAL1,@0.04@|ena|[color=yellow]...
MURAL5_DIAL2,"|moony|[color=grey]...Ena, I-"
MURAL5_DIAL3,|ena|[color=yellow]Its alright. We simply had a disagreement.
MURAL5_DIAL4,|moony|[color=grey]But you completely fell apart after all of that!
MURAL5_DIAL5,"|ena|[color=yellow]Thinking back, I've come to understand that staying happy wasn't ideal."
MURAL5_DIAL6,"|ena|[color=yellow]I just hope that one day, I'll be able to gain stability over my life."

INTRO_MESSAGE1,"After a long journey, Ena and Moony have finally arrived at the carbon castle outside of existence, where the final [color=red]glitched rift [color=white]resides."
INTRO_MESSAGE2,"These unstable anomalies began to appear throughout the dimensions after their escape from the room of RUNAS, threatening to destabilize all of creation."
INTRO_MESSAGE3,"In order to have made their journey possible, Moony had to give up her wish to a [color=purple]mysterious entity [color=white]in order for them both to escape the graveyard."
INTRO_MESSAGE4,"And so after they escaped, they began closing the rifts with help from the [color=purple]entity [color=white]and people they met along the way. One of them being the very king of this castle."
INTRO_MESSAGE5,"In spite of inner conflict and ENA's relapse, they have managed to track down their former ally to this place. What could the mysterious man want with the rift as well?"

THRONE_DIAL3,[color=#ffa500]…Maybe I don’t have to d-
THRONE_DIAL4,[color=#ffa500]Oh. So you finally arrived.
THRONE_DIAL5,[color=#ffa500]It certainly took you two a while to get here.
THRONE_DIAL6,"|moony|[color=grey]Uh, dude. We’ve been looking all over for you!"
THRONE_DIAL7,|ena|[color=yellow]Verily! Why did you depart from us?
THRONE_DIAL8,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]…This is what we’ve all been searching for, isn't it?"
THRONE_DIAL9,[color=#ffa500]The very thing threatening all of [color=red]existence.
THRONE_DIAL10,[color=#ffa500]...
THRONE_DIAL11,"[color=#ffa500]Ever since I left you two, I’ve been busy."
THRONE_DIAL12,[color=#ffa500]I've been trying to figure out how to stop the [color=purple]rift [color=#ffa500].
THRONE_DIAL13,"[color=#ffa500]Now that you're both here, my plan can move forward."
THRONE_DIAL14,[color=#ffa500]A plan that can truly guarantee the end of our quest.
THRONE_DIAL15,|moony|[color=grey]Great! One question.
THRONE_DIAL16,[color=grey]WHY COULDN'T YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO US BEFORE YOU LEFT?
THRONE_DIAL17,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]Originally, I felt like I was capable enough to solve this. "
THRONE_DIAL18,"|ena|[color=yellow]Chums are supposed to stick together. We're a team, remember?"
THRONE_DIAL19,|moony|[color=grey]Yeah. Tell us where you’re going next time ya nerd.
THRONE_DIAL20,|meist|[color=#ffa500]Fair enough.
THRONE_DIAL21,[color=#ffa500]...
THRONE_DIAL22,[color=#ffa500]Then let us complete this long journey. ||
HALLWAY_DIAL1,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]Remember what I said about my world, Ena?"
HALLWAY_DIAL2,[color=#ffa500]It was a complete paradise. There was next to no suffering.
HALLWAY_DIAL3,[color=#ffa500]But it wasn’t perfect.
HALLWAY_DIAL4,"[color=#ffa500]As our people lived very long lives, we were beginning to run out of space."
HALLWAY_DIAL5,[color=#ffa500]And so I was tasked by the royal family to solve this issue.
HALLWAY_DIAL6,"[color=#ffa500]Unfortunately, as you can see, it was all in vain."
HALLWAY_DIAL7,"[color=#ffa500]But now, I can finally fix all of this."
HALLWAY_DIAL8,"|ena|[color=yellow]Pray tell us chum, how did your world die?"
HALLWAY_DIAL9,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...
HALLWAY_DIAL10,"|moony|[color=grey]But we can fix this, and stop the rift. Right?"
HALLWAY_DIAL11,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]Of course, but it won’t be an easy task."
HALLWAY_DIAL12,"|moony|[color=grey]Uh, what do you mean by that?"
HALLWAY_DIAL13,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL1,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...What is this?
GARDEN_DIAL2,|ena|[color=yellow]What seems to be the issue?
GARDEN_DIAL3,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL4,[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL5,[color=#ffa500]I think it's time to tell you my plan.
GARDEN_DIAL6,"[color=#ffa500]Throughout your journey, you have gained so much power."
GARDEN_DIAL7,[color=#ffa500]The power you wield is most certainly enough to destroy the glitched rift.
GARDEN_DIAL8,"[color=#ffa500]However, I cannot allow this to happen."
GARDEN_DIAL9,"[color=#ffa500]If you destroy it now, I will never have another chance to save my world."
GARDEN_DIAL10,[color=#ffa500]That is why…
GARDEN_DIAL11,[color=#ffa500]...

GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL15,[color=yellow]Who are you?
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL16,"[color=green]I have been supressed here, shattered ever since our creation."
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL17,"[color=green]I could barely comphrehend, but observe what happened on the outside."
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL18,[color=green]I am the very CONTROL you both seek for our body.
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL19,"[color=green]However, we lost our ESSENCE. So you both cannot return to it."
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL20,[color=yellow]Well thats wonderful to hear! So you're saying we're done for?
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL21,[color=green]Patience...
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL22,[color=yellow]...
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL23,[color=green]No. We still have one more chance to make things right.
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL24,"[color=green]However, in order to return to the point before the fight, we must unite."
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL25,[color=blue]So what you're saying is... 
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL26,[color=yellow]We can no longer be at odds with each other.
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL27,[color=blue]Then our heart...
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL28,[color=yellow]Our mind...
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL29,[color=green]Our very body...
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL30,[color=green]Must become one.
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL31,"[color=green]So that maybe, with what little power we have..."
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL32,"[color=green]We can save[color=#ffa500]Meist,[color=green]too."
GAMEOVER_AFTERMATH_NEUTRAL_DIAL32,"|nar|[color=##007eff]What happens here, is up to you now, [Playername]"

GARDEN_NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL1,...
GARDEN_NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL2,[color=#ffa500]...I think it's time to tell you my plan.
GARDEN_NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL3,"[color=#ffa500]Throughout your journey, you have gained so much power."
GARDEN_NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL4,[color=#ffa500]The power you wield is most certainly enough to destroy the glitched rift.
GARDEN_NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL5,"[color=#ffa500]However, I cannot allow this to happen."
GARDEN_NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL6,"[color=#ffa500]If you destroy it now, I will never have another chance to save my world."
GARDEN_NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL7,[color=#ffa500]That is why…
GARDEN_NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL8,[color=#ffa500]...

NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL_3,"|ena|[color=green]...I died, Meist. But not by your hand."
NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL_4,"|ena|[color=green]I couldn't bear fighting you anymore, let alone the thought of killing you."
NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL_5,|ena|[color=green]But now I have finally gained CONTROL over myself. So please...
NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL_6,"|ena|[color=green]Lets seal the rift, and go home. "
NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL_7,"|moony| [color=grey] Come back to us, we'll find another way to save your kingdom dude."
NEUTRAL_PREPHASE2_DIAL_8,"|ena| [color=green] Although things may never be the same, we will grow and move on from this, together."

NARRATOR_DIALOGUE_PREPHASE2_DIAL_3,"|nar|[color=purple]So now, in the name of my master, I will plague your mind..."
