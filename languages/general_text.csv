INTRO_MESSAGE1,"After a long journey throughout many dimensions, Ena and Moony have finally arrived at the ruined castle, where the [color=purple]glitched rift [color=white]resides."
INTRO_MESSAGE2,"It is a dimensional tear that is not only capable of destroying the dimension it is in, but also the surrounding ones. This one in particular is so dangerous that it threatens to destroy all of creation. 
"
INTRO_MESSAGE3,"Despite their inexperience and fear of the unknown, Ena and Moony with some help along the way, were able to defeat the challenges thrown at them and make their way here."
INTRO_MESSAGE4,"However, unbeknownst to the duo, one of their former party members has already beaten them to this cursed place. What could this mysterious man want with the rift as well?

THRONE_DIAL2,[color=#ffa500]...
THRONE_DIAL3,[color=#ffa500]…Maybe I don’t have to d-
THRONE_DIAL4,[color=#ffa500]Oh. So you finally arrived.
THRONE_DIAL5,[color=#ffa500]It certainly took you two a while to get here.
THRONE_DIAL6,"|moony|[color=grey]Uh, dude. We’ve been looking all over for you!"
THRONE_DIAL7,|ena|[color=yellow]Verily! Why did you depart from us?
THRONE_DIAL8,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]…This is what we’ve all been searching for, isn't it?"
THRONE_DIAL9,[color=#ffa500]The very thing threatening all of [color=red]existence.
THRONE_DIAL10,[color=#ffa500]...
THRONE_DIAL11,"[color=#ffa500]Ever since I left you two, I’ve been busy."
THRONE_DIAL12,[color=#ffa500]I've been trying to figure out how to stop the [color=purple]rift [color=#ffa500]myself.
THRONE_DIAL13,"[color=#ffa500]And so now, my plan can move forward."
THRONE_DIAL14,[color=#ffa500]A plan that can truly guarantee the end of our quest.
THRONE_DIAL15,|moony|[color=grey]Great! One question.
THRONE_DIAL16,[color=grey]WHY COULDN'T YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO US BEFORE YOU LEFT?
THRONE_DIAL17,|meist|[color=#ffa500]I felt like I was more capable to solve this. 
THRONE_DIAL18,"|ena|[color=yellow]Chums are supposed to stick together. We're a team, remember?"
THRONE_DIAL19,|moony|[color=grey]Yeah. Tell us where you’re going next time ya nerd.
THRONE_DIAL20,|meist|[color=#ffa500]Fair enough.
THRONE_DIAL21,[color=#ffa500]...
THRONE_DIAL22,[color=#ffa500]Then let us complete this long journey. ||
HALLWAY_DIAL1,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]I haven’t told you much about my world, haven’t I Ena?"
HALLWAY_DIAL2,[color=#ffa500]It was a complete paradise. There was next to no suffering.
HALLWAY_DIAL3,[color=#ffa500]But it wasn’t perfect.
HALLWAY_DIAL4,"[color=#ffa500]As our people lived very long lives, we were beginning to run out of space."
HALLWAY_DIAL5,[color=#ffa500]And so I was tasked by the royal family to solve this issue.
HALLWAY_DIAL6,"[color=#ffa500]Unfortunately as you can see, it was all in vain."
HALLWAY_DIAL7,"[color=#ffa500]But now however, I can finally fix all of this."
HALLWAY_DIAL8,"|ena|[color=yellow]Pray tell us chum, how did your world die?"
HALLWAY_DIAL9,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...
HALLWAY_DIAL10,"|moony|[color=grey]But you can fix this, and stop the rift. Right?"
HALLWAY_DIAL11,"|meist|[color=#ffa500]Of course, but it won’t be an easy task."
HALLWAY_DIAL12,"|moony|[color=grey]Uh, what do you mean by that?"
HALLWAY_DIAL13,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL1,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...What is this?
GARDEN_DIAL2,|ena|[color=yellow]What seems to be the issue?
GARDEN_DIAL3,|meist|[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL4,[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL5,[color=#ffa500]I think it's time to tell you my plan.
GARDEN_DIAL6,"[color=#ffa500]Throughout your journey, you have gained so much power."
GARDEN_DIAL7,"[color=#ffa500]The power you wield, is most certainly enough to destroy the glitched rift."
GARDEN_DIAL8,"[color=#ffa500]However, I cannot allow this to happen."
GARDEN_DIAL9,"[color=#ffa500]If you destroy it now, I will never have another chance to save my world."
GARDEN_DIAL10,[color=#ffa500]That is why…
GARDEN_DIAL11,[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL12,[color=#ffa500]...
GARDEN_DIAL13,[color=#ffa500]…I need to take your ESSENCE.
GARDEN_DIAL14,|ena|[color=blue]W-WHAT?!
BATTLE_TRANSITION1,Light protrudes throughout the garden.
BATTLE_TRANSITION2,You begin to feel the air around you getting warmer.
BATTLE_TRANSITION3,It seems like your journey has finally come to an end.
BATTLE_TRANSITION4,Your emotions begin to stir greatly within you.
BATTLE_TRANSITION5,"[color=#ffa500]|meist|Ena, Moony, this was a very pleasant adventure."
BATTLE_TRANSITION6,[color=#ffa500]But I must do what I can to save my people.
BATTLE_TRANSITION7,[color=#ffa500]...

ENA_TALK_REASON1_DIAL_2,[color=blue]It doesnt have to end this way!
ENA_TALK_REASON1_DIAL_3,"|moony|[color=grey]All of your genius, and this is your plan?!"
ENA_TALK_REASON1_DIAL_4,[color=grey]I agree! Stop this lunacy at once!
